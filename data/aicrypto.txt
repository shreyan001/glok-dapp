Introduction
 023 proved monumental for artificial intelligence (“AI”), as the transformative power of AI
2
became more evident, notably with the widespread use of AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s
ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and others. ChatGPT, in particular,
highlighted AI’s potential by reaching the milestone of 100 million users in just two months
- an achievement that outpaced major social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube.

 n a more relevant note, AI has also started to reshape the crypto landscape, both in
O
practical use cases as well as heightened interest in AI-related tokens. The fusion of these
two disruptive technologies has quickly risen to a prominent narrative within the industry.
Building onour previous reportthat shed light onthe use cases of AI in crypto, we now
revisit this evolving landscape. In light of the recent renewal of interest in the field, we will
take a look at the current state of the market and examine new developments.

State of the Market
I n 2023, the public’s interest in AI saw a significant upswing, evidenced by the marked
increase in “AI” searches on Google worldwide. This heightened interest suggests a
growing public engagement with AI-related topics. This surge is largely attributed to the
popularity of AI chatbots, the launch of new AI tools, as well as increased media coverage
and desire to learn about AI.
 igure 2: Google search interest in AI saw a significant uptick in 2023, greatly
F
surpassing that of “Crypto” and “Bitcoin”

Note: Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time.

 onversely, the search interest for “Crypto” remained relatively stable throughout the year.
C
It exhibited a slight downward trend from January to May, followed by a period of stability,
and then experienced a minor uptick toward the end of the year. The search trends of
“Bitcoin” mirrored that of “Crypto”, but with more notable fluctuations. This volatility in
Bitcoin interest can be linked to the several heated narratives surrounding Bitcoin,
including Ordinals/BRC-20s, potential spot ETFs, and the halving in 2024. These events
contributed to an increase in Bitcoin’s price, reigniting public interest.
 verall, the search trends reveal a clear divergence between the growing interest in AI and
O
the relatively stable interest in Bitcoin and Crypto, indicating that AI has been capturing the
public’s attention at an increasing rate, with no apparent signs of interest waning so far.

Robust Investor Interest
 he AI sector also showcased a robust performance regarding investor interest in 2023.
T
Despite an overall reduction in funding amounts, AI’s share of US startup funding grew by
230% in relative terms, accounting for approximately 26%. This growth occurred in a
context where both AI and Non-AI sectors experienced a downturn in funding. However, AI
showed particular resilience compared to the broader market.

*Note: The most recent data for 2023 was not available at the time of publication. Readers are advised to take
this limitation into account when interpreting the analysis.

 hile Non-AI sectors witnessed a significant 65% decrease in absolute funding amount
W
from 2022,the reduction in AI funding was comparativelymodest at just 6%.
Additionally, when considering the number of funding rounds, non-AI sectors experienced
a 55% decrease, whereas the AI sector saw a 45% reduction. This comparatively smaller
decline in AI funding and funding rounds indicates that investor interest in AI applications
remains relatively high, despite the overall downtrend in funding amount since its peak in
2021. This could also suggest a sustained belief in the long-term potential of and viability
of AI technology and applications.
 dditionally, the AI sector within Web3 experienced explosive growth in terms of funding in
A
2023. Data from Rootdata reveals a stark contrast between the collective funding amount
for AI projects from 2016 to 2022, which totaled US$148.5M, and the funding amount in
2023 alone, which reached US$298M(1).This figurefor 2023 is double the total funding
of the previous seven years, reflecting AI’s surging traction within the year.

in 2023 ranked 7th, surpassing NFT at US$293M and DAO at US$42M. This funding
represented about 3.7% of the total funding for Web3 projects in 2023. While 3.7% might
appear modest, it’s quite notable considering AI only started gaining significant traction in
2023, and this considerable growth in funding underlines the increasing recognition and
value placed on the sector.

Strong Outperformance
 rom a price perspective, AI tokens have also outperformed the broader market and
F
experienced a significant surge over the past quarter and year. A rise in interest in the
sector has contributed to the strong price performance in AI-related tokens.
 igure 5: AI tokens ranked as the second-best performing category over the last three

 ccording to a Dune dashboard that aggregates the performance of representative tokens
A
across different narratives/sectors, AI tokens ranked as the second-best performing
category over the last three months. Note that although the original dashboard includes
meme coins, we've excluded them from our analysis given the disproportionate large
percentage performance gains as a result of their relatively lower market capitalization.
 hen comparing the top five AI tokens, in terms of market capitalization, against BTC and
W
ETH, it’s evident that AI tokens significantly outperformed the majors in 2023. The
one-year performance of these AI coins varied from 200% to as high as 650%. In contrast,
BTC ended the year with a gain of 150%, while ETH registered a 44%.
 owever, it’s crucial to note that BTC and ETH have much larger market capitalizations
H
compared to these AI tokens. Consequently, it’s natural for BTC and ETH to experience
smaller gains in terms of percentage. This comparison primarily serves to highlight the
strong performance and growing traction of AI coins in the recent months.

 verall, AI has been gaining significant traction. The adoption of AI applications has been
O
on an accelerating climb, attracting sustained interest from investors and retail. Moreover,
the performance of AI tokens has been robust. Alongside these trends, there are several
emerging AI x Crypto innovations that are worth discussing, as detailed in the following
section.

AI x Crypto Developments
 he surge in interest in AI has fueled the growth of AI-related crypto applications, paving
T
the way for continuous innovation in the sector. In this section, we delve into some trends
and tangible use cases that have emerged from the convergence of AI and crypto
technologies. From powering the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks
(“DePIN”), to the creation of more interactive consumer-facing applications, we highlight a
few notable developments in this field.

AI x DePIN
 arge language models, deep learning, and various AI applications rely heavily on graphics
L
processing units (“GPUs”) for computational power. However, over the past year,
burgeoning interest in AI has led to an outsized demand for GPUs, leading to a shortage of
chips(2). Without easy access to GPUs, the high costof computing can be prohibitive for
researchers and start-ups doing AI-related research.This is where decentralized
compute networks, a subset of DePIN come in. They provide an alternative to existing
solutions dominated by centralized cloud providers and hardware manufacturers.As a
result, we have also witnessed strong growth of the sector driven by demand for GPUs.
 iven that GPUs do not operate at 100% capacity all the time, decentralized compute
G
networks seek to connect those with idle computing power to those who require them. This
is achieved by establishing a two-sided marketplace that allows suppliers of computing
power to receive incentives from the buyers. Examples of such networks include Akash,
Render, Gensyn, and io.net, among others. Moreover, prices of decentralized compute
networks are also competitive as there are no significant additional costs for suppliers to
provide computing power to the network.

AI x Zero-Knowledge
 mart contracts are known for their efficiency due to their code-based automation
S
capabilities. However, their predefined nature can sometimes lead to a lack of adaptability,
particularly in unforeseen complex situations. This is where machine learning (“ML”), a
subfield of AI, can offer significant improvements. ML models, trained on extensive
datasets, have the ability to learn, adapt, and make highly accurate predictions. Integrating
these models into smart contracts could open up a wide range of adaptable and flexible
capacity.
 ne major challenge in this integration is the exorbitant computational overhead of
O
on-chain ML computation. This leads to the concept of Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning
("ZKML"). ZKML combines zero-knowledge proofs with machine learning. In this setup,ML
computations are processed off-chain, while ZK proofs are used to verify the integrity
of these computations without revealing the actual data.Utilizing ZKML, smart contracts
can effectively leverage the power of AI while maintaining the security and transparency of
blockchain technology.

 notable development is the ZK Predictor introduced by Upshot in collaboration with
A
Modulus Labs. This tool enables Upshot to leverage Modulus ZK circuits for verifying asset
valuation without revealing proprietary intellectual property. It can be instrumental in
developing Automated Market Maker (“AMM”) optimized for pricing long-tail assets,
AI-driven on-chain index funds that come with on-chain cryptography proofs of their
operation, or prediction market focussed on specialized topics, where the accuracy of
crowd-power pricing signals can be enhanced and verified(3).Other ZKML products include
price oracle(4). For instance, Upshot feeds its AImodels with complex market data to
appraise the value of long-tail assets like NFTs. Modulus’s tech then verifies the
correctness of these AI computations, encapsulates them in proofs, and submits them to
Ethereum for final verification.

 hese examples represent just the beginning of the myriad applications that ZKML can
T
enable. As the tech is still in its infancy, more matured and widespread ZKML applications
could be expected in the coming years.

AI x Consumer dApps
 ver the past year, we have observed a rise of AI integration in consumer-facing
O
decentralized applications (“dApps”) to increase interactivity and foster user participation.
This trend is transforming the way users engage with platforms, offering both
personalization and interactivity.By leveraging AI,such dApps empower users to shift
from mere users to active participants.
 n example is AI user-generated content (“UGC”) platforms such asNFPrompt. As the
A
term suggests, AI UGC refers to content created by users with the help of an autonomous
system. This is broadly achieved by putting in place a set of rules that automates the output
and embedding some form of randomness in the algorithm. In other words, users can input
a set of rules or constraints (e.g., patterns, colors, shapes) and the AI will generate the
content based on this framework. By involving users in the creation process, AI UGC
platforms establish a more participatory relationship between users and the platform,
while also allowing users to come up with unique, one-of-a-kind content that are infinitely
scalable.

 eyond content generation, the integration of AI could have profound implications for
B
web3 gaming or virtual worlds where in-game characters are significantly more interactive,
and conversations become more life-like.SleeplessAI’s games “HIM” and “HER” are good
examples. By using AI, the gameplay is characterized by focusing on customized and
realistic communication. This offers a more personalized experience and fosters more
authentic emotional connections to boost user engagement.

AI x Data Analytics
 ccurate market data is key to understanding industry trends and is important for investors
A
to make informed investment decisions. However, instances of ingenuine trades, such as
wash trades, may artificially inflate sales and distort true sales volume. By integrating AI
into the analysis to filter out noise, more accurate data output is possible. This is broadly
achieved through AI and machine learning (“ML”), whereby huge volumes of data are fed as
an input to identify wash trading patterns or trends. The end result is a more accurate
depiction of market activity.
 ase in point is BitsCrunch, an AI-powered NFT data analytics platform, which utilizes AI
C
and machine learning to detect wash trading or suspicious trading patterns in real time,
thereby providing accurate data.The use of AI/MLallows the platform to analyze a large
amount of data with relative ease, allowing the platform to differentiate between true
and inorganic trading volume.This, in turn, aidsinformed decision making.
